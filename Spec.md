# **Product Specification: Smart Scheduling Assistant (Browser Extension)**

## **1. Purpose & Vision**
The Smart Scheduling Assistant is an AI-driven browser extension that passively monitors user conversations and activities (with permission) to detect scheduling intents. It streamlines the process of creating, updating, and managing events in users’ calendars—even coordinating event details with multiple attendees—by leveraging context from various platforms (e.g., Gmail web client, web-based SMS, Instagram DMs, Slack, etc.).

### **Key Objectives**
1. **Centralized Scheduling**: Provide a “one-stop” interface for all scheduling needs, capturing relevant context from any authorized browser-based app or service.
2. **Automated Reminders & Suggestions**: At the end of each day, suggest unconfirmed or upcoming event items for final review, helping users avoid missed tasks.
3. **Company/Organization Integration**: Allow organizations to integrate their internal room-booking systems, meeting availability, or resources, streamlining enterprise use cases.
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Learn over time from user interactions and contact preferences to optimize scheduling suggestions and contacts grouping.

## **2. User Personas & Use Cases**
1. **Busy Professionals**  
   - **Scenario**: Jane is a project manager with multiple daily meetings. She wants an easy way to schedule new meetings based on Slack or email conversations without manually copying details into a calendar.  
   - **Need**: Automated meeting invites, availability checks, daily summary of pending events.

2. **Students/Personal Users**  
   - **Scenario**: Alex is planning a trip to Santa Catalina Island with friends. The details are scattered across Gmail threads and social media messages.  
   - **Need**: Automatic detection of partial or tentative travel plans; daily or weekly reminders to confirm.

3. **Corporate/Enterprise Users**  
   - **Scenario**: An employee wants to book a conference room. The company’s tool is buried in an intranet site.  
   - **Need**: Text-based or speech-based prompt (“Book Room 204 on Thursday from 10-11 AM”); extension checks availability and finalizes the reservation.

## **3. Feature Breakdown**

1. **Passive Detection & Context Extraction**  
   - Scans authorized browser tabs (e.g., Gmail, Slack, Instagram) for phrases indicating scheduling or planning.  
   - NLP models parse text to identify relevant info (location, time, participants, context).

2. **Daily Digest**  
   - Presents a summary of all scheduling-related activities each day (and optionally at user-specified intervals).  
   - Allows user to confirm or dismiss events with a single click.

3. **Quick Event Creation**  
   - AI-driven text or voice prompts: e.g., “Send a calendar invite to Maxwell for 9:58–10:50 AM about his startup ideas.”  
   - Extension automatically checks availability (if user’s or invitee’s calendar is shared).  
   - Optionally sends invites through user’s preferred calendar application (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.).

4. **Learning & Autocomplete**  
   - Learns from user’s past scheduling behavior (favorite meeting times, typical contacts, frequently used conference rooms).  
   - Autocompletes recipients and suggests times or rooms based on usage history.

5. **Company Customization**  
   - Integrates with internal booking or scheduling systems (e.g., an organization’s in-house room reservation APIs).  
   - Can be customized to reflect corporate branding, specialized resources, or scheduling rules.

6. **Privacy & Permission Controls**  
   - Users explicitly grant the extension permission to read certain browser tabs, emails, or chats.  
   - Extension surfaces a transparent explanation of what data is accessed and how it’s used (HIPAA/PII guidelines if needed).

## **4. Technical Architecture**

1. **Browser Extension**  
   - **Background Script**:  
     - Maintains persistent event listeners, scans authorized tabs for scheduling context.  
     - Manages communication between content scripts and the extension’s backend server (if applicable).
   - **Content Scripts**:  
     - Injected into specific domains (e.g., Gmail web client).  
     - Observes DOM changes and captures text for scheduling keywords.  
     - Sends relevant text blocks to the background script for further NLP processing.
   - **Popup/UI**:  
     - An interface shown when the user clicks the extension icon.  
     - Displays daily summary, allows quick acceptance/rejection of events, and advanced features (manual scheduling, prompts, etc.).

2. **Core AI/NLP**  
   - **Local vs. Remote**:  
     - Could run simpler NLP rules locally, or rely on a remote AI service for advanced language models.  
     - If remote, the browser extension must securely send sanitized text to a backend for processing.
   - **Key Functions**:  
     - Entity Recognition (dates, times, locations, people).  
     - Intent Classification (identify “plan,” “schedule,” “meeting,” etc.).  
     - Natural Language Generation (suggest event titles, reminders).

3. **Backend & Database** (Optional for MVP)  
   - **Backend (Cloud or On-Premises)**  
     - Handles advanced AI computations, data storage, corporate integrations (room booking APIs).  
     - Authenticates user identity and sessions.  
   - **Database**  
     - Stores user preferences, past interactions, scheduling patterns.  
     - Might track the user’s partial or unconfirmed events for improved daily suggestions.

4. **Third-Party Integrations**  
   - **Calendar Services**: Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, or corporate calendars.  
   - **Communication Platforms**: Slack, Gmail, LinkedIn messages, IG DMs.  
   - **Authentication**: OAuth flows to gain authorized read/write access (e.g., Gmail).

## **5. Data Flow**

1. **User Grants Permissions**:  
   - User installs the extension and chooses which services (Gmail, Slack, etc.) can be monitored.
2. **Real-Time Parsing**:  
   - Content script reads text from the browser’s DOM.  
   - Summaries or text snippets are sent to the background script for NLP or forwarded to the backend service if the model is remote.
3. **Scheduling Detected**:  
   - The system extracts possible event details (e.g., date/time, location, participants).  
   - The system either prompts the user immediately or adds the item to the “Daily Digest.”
4. **User Reviews**:  
   - At day’s end (or specified interval), the user sees recommended events.  
   - User either approves, modifies, or discards the suggestions.
5. **Calendar Update**:  
   - Once approved, the extension calls the appropriate calendar API to create or update the event, sending invites as needed.

## **6. User Interface & Experience**

1. **Extension Popup**  
   - **Home Tab**: Daily summary of potential events or tasks found.  
   - **Quick Action Buttons**: “Accept,” “Edit & Accept,” “Dismiss.”  
2. **Modal Dialog / Notification**  
   - Automatic pop-up when the extension strongly detects a scheduling context (optional setting).  
   - “Potential event found: [Title, Date/Time]. Add to calendar?”
3. **Settings Panel**  
   - Manage which platforms are monitored.  
   - Manage daily digest times.  
   - Manage contact groups / frequently invited contacts.  
   - Manage organizational integrations (e.g., room booking services).

## **7. Privacy & Security**

1. **Permission Transparency**  
   - Clearly list what data the extension can see (email body, message text, etc.).  
   - Only store minimal data necessary (event title, time, location, participants).
2. **Compliance Considerations**  
   - If the tool is expanded to enterprise use, it may require alignment with privacy regulations (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA if in healthcare contexts, etc.).  
   - Provide encryption in transit (HTTPS or secure WebSocket to the backend).
3. **User Control**  
   - Allow easy revocation of permissions.  
   - Enable user to specify sensitive or private channels that are excluded from scanning.

## **9. Potential Technical & Business Challenges**

- **Data Privacy**: Must handle sensitive user conversations with top-tier security and transparency.  
- **Complex Calendars**: Users may have multiple overlapping calendars (work vs. personal). The extension must unify or carefully choose which calendar to populate.  
- **System Integration**: Each new messaging or enterprise platform requires a separate authentication and API integration.  
- **Scalability**: As user base grows, back-end AI processing must handle large volumes of text analysis.  
- **User Adoption**: Users need robust controls and trust in privacy; the extension must demonstrate clear value to overcome friction of granting access to personal data.

## **10. Success Metrics**

- **Daily & Weekly Active Users**: How many people rely on the extension regularly?
- **Detected vs. Confirmed Events**: Ratio indicating how accurately the assistant spots real scheduling items.  
- **Time Saved**: Survey or telemetry data showing user workflow improvements (e.g., minutes spent scheduling before vs. after adoption).  
- **User Satisfaction**: Qualitative feedback on whether the app’s suggestions are useful, or if it intrudes with false positives.

### **Conclusion**
This **Smart Scheduling Assistant (Browser Extension)** specification outlines a robust MVP for automatically detecting and creating calendar events from user communications. By focusing first on the browser extension, you can rapidly iterate on the core NLP features and user experience before expanding to native iOS/macOS and Android applications. 

Ultimately, the product’s success hinges on balancing **convenience** (accurately capturing events) with **privacy** (transparent, user-controlled access). Once these elements are proven in the browser extension, the broader vision—offering a multi-platform “GPT for scheduling”—can follow naturally.
